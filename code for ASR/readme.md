This directory houses a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed for transcribing WAV audio files using a variety of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) algorithms.

Note: The outcome of running the code in each notebook is a one-column dataset structure, with each row representing a transcript.

It's important to note that you'll typically want to associate each transcript with the corresponding audio file. We recommend naming your audio files in a way that includes an identifier (e.g., a unique ID) within their names. This identifier can then be extracted and stored in a second column of your dataset after you have imported the files. The order of the IDs will correspond to the order of the transcripts in the dataset.

By following this approach, you'll have a structured dataset that maintains the association between transcripts and their respective audio files, making it easier to analyze and utilize the transcriptions in your data science and computational projects.

Let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance with using the ASR algorithms and organizing the transcriptions effectively. üéßüìù
